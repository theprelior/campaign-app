# Replace [YOUR-PASSWORD] with your database password
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.xxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# A secret key for NextAuth.js. You can generate one with the command: `openssl rand -base64 32`
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Your GitHub OAuth App credentials
# Create one at https://github.com/settings/developers
# The Authorization callback URL should be: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github
AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your_github_client_id"
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your_github_client_secret"
```
